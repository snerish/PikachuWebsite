        <p>My favourite character is 'Pikachu' from "Pokemon".Pikachu is a electric-type species of Pokémon, fictional creatures that appear in an assortment of video games, television shows, movies, trading card games, and comic books licensed by The Pokémon Company. It is a yellow mouse-like creature with powerful electrical abilities. In most vocalized appearances, including the anime and certain video games, it is primarily voiced by Ikue Ōtani. A Pikachu also appears as part of the main cast in the live-action animated film Pokémon Detective Pikachu, played in CGI and voiced by Ryan Reynolds.

            The Pikachu design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori.Pikachu first appeared in Pokémon Red and Green in Japan, and later in the first internationally released Pokémon video games, Pokémon Red and Blue, for the original Game Boy.

            Pikachu is the best-known species of Pokémon, largely because Pikachu is a central character (starter Pokémon of Ash) in the Pokémon anime series. Pikachu is a major character of the Pokémon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years and one of the major mascots for Nintendo.</p>
